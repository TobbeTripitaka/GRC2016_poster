 abstract      = {Wilkes Land is a key region for studying the configuration of Gondwana and for appreciating the role of tectonic boundary conditions on East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) behavior. Despite this importance, it remains one of the largest regions on Earth where we lack a basic knowledge of geology. New magnetic, gravity, and subglacial topography data allow the region's first comprehensive geological interpretation. We map lithospheric domains and their bounding faults, including the suture between Indo-Antarctica and Australo-Antarctica. Furthermore, we image subglacial sedimentary basins, including the Aurora and Knox Subglacial Basins and the previously unknown Sabrina Subglacial Basin. Commonality of structure in magnetic, gravity, and topography data suggest that pre-EAIS tectonic features are a primary control on subglacial topography. The preservation of this relationship after glaciation suggests that these tectonic features provide topographic and basal boundary conditions that have strongly influenced the structure and evolution of the EAIS.},

 abstract      = {P-to-S receiver functions (PRFs) from the Polar Earth Observing Network (POLENET) GPS and seismic leg of POLENET spanning West Antarctica and the Transantarctic Mountains deployment of seismographic stations provide new estimates of crustal thickness across West Antarctica, including the West Antarctic Rift System (WARS), Marie Byrd Land (MBL) dome, and the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) margin. We show that complications arising from ice sheet multiples can be effectively managed and further information concerning low-velocity subglacial sediment thickness may be determined, via top-down utilization of synthetic receiver function models. We combine shallow structure constraints with the response of deeper layers using a regularized Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology to constrain bulk crustal properties. Crustal thickness estimates range from 17.0±4 km at Fishtail Point in the western WARS to 45±5 km at Lonewolf Nunataks in the TAM. Symmetric regions of crustal thinning observed in a transect deployment across the West Antarctic Ice Sheet correlate with deep subice basins, consistent with pure shear crustal necking under past localized extension. Subglacial sediment deposit thicknesses generally correlate with trough/dome expectations, with the thickest inferred subice low-velocity sediment estimated as ∼0.4 km within the Bentley Subglacial Trench. Inverted PRFs from this study and other published crustal estimates are combined with ambient noise surface wave constraints to generate a crustal thickness map for West Antarctica south of 75°S. Observations are consistent with isostatic crustal compensation across the central WARS but indicate significant mantle compensation across the TAM, Ellsworth Block, MBL dome, and eastern and western sectors of thinnest WARS crust, consistent with low density and likely dynamic, low-viscosity high-temperature mantle.},

 abstract      = {The Lambert Glacier region of East Antarctica encompasses the proposed boundary between three of the ancient continents that formed East Gondwana: Indo-Antarctica, the central East Antarctic Craton and a proposed extension of the Pinjarra Orogen of Australia. The only area of extensive rock exposure in central East Antarctica, it uniquely allows the seismic structure to be linked to surface geology. New broadband seismic stations were established at the remote sites of the SSCUA deployment, which ran between the austral summers of 2002/2003 and 2004/ 2005. Recorded energy from distant earthquakes is used to calculate receiver function waveforms that are then modelled to deduce the seismic structure of the upper lithosphere. The results of this study are two-fold. Firstly, seismic structure and crustal depth are determined beneath the Lambert Glacier region providing constraints on its tectonic evolution. A significant contrast in crustal depth is found between the Northern and Southern Prince Charles Mountains that may indicate the location of a major tectonic boundary. Secondly, baseline seismic receiver structures are established for the Rayner, Fisher and Lambert terranes that may be traced beneath the Antarctic ice sheet in the future. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.
